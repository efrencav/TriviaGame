#Idea
My approach to each activity is to build something that will teach me a new way of thinking. The theme of this application was to create a Retro Style trivia game that will ask questions in general to an audience that grew up in the 1990's.

Here's how it works:
- Click on the Play Game button to tstart the timed questions. You will have 30 seconds to answer each question.
- If the player selects the correct answer, they will see the winning screen. After 4 seconds the screen will change to the next question. 
- If you choose the wrong answer, you will see an animated Giphy that says your selection was wrong.
- On the final screen, you will be able to review the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, timed-oud questions and an option to restart the game. 
- Enjoy!

The game uses basic jQuery methods and timers.
